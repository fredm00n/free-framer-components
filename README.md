# Figleaf components for Framer

Figleaf is a package fo two compoenents, allows the designer to create graphic elements close to those found in nature without coding :

* Distortion component allows a Perlin noise type deformation to be applied to a graphic object.

* Pattern component allows the creation of colours and gradients whose characteristics (hue, saturation, luminosity, alpha) are partially defined using random variables. It also allows the generation of graphics using different Perlin noise functions.

The association of the 2 components Pattern and Distortion allows the creation of graphic forms and textures of an infinite richness.

To use Figleaf :
* [Create a Framer account](https://login.framer.com/sign-up/?ref=site&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fframer.com%2F)
* Install Framer on your computer or access its web version
* Go to [the project in framer.com Showcase](https://www.framer.com/showcase/project/sOrHUTSYXT7302rRXCrC/) and click on *Duplicate in Framer*.
